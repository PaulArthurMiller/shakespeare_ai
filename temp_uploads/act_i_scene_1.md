ACT I

SCENE 1

[Enter SQUIDWARD, carrying his clarinet and sheet music. He arranges his music stand meticulously center stage.]

SQUIDWARD
At last, the silent sanctuary of my home,
Where genius may unfold without the rabble's noise.
Today I'll master Kelpy G's Nocturne in B-flat,
And prove that greatness lurks beneath this tentacled frame.
The world may mock Squidward Tentacles today,
But history shall vindify my artistic soul!
When I am gone, these walls will echo with my name,
Museums will display my portraits, critics praise my sound.
While others waste their fleeting lives in mindless toil,
I craft a legacy that time cannot erode.

[He positions his clarinet, takes a deep breath, and plays a few screeching notes before a loud BANG interrupts from outside]

What crude disturbance dares to violate my practice?
The universe conspires against true talent, as it must.
The mediocre masses fear what they can't comprehend.

[SQUIDWARD moves to the window, peering out irritably]

SQUIDWARD
Patrick Star! What senseless commotion are you making?

[Enter PATRICK, looking innocent and confused]

PATRICK
Huh? Oh, hi Squidward! I'm just standing here,
Being Patrick. That's my job. I do it every day.
Nobody pays me though. Should someone pay me?
For being Patrick? I'm pretty good at it.

SQUIDWARD
I heard a hammering sound that rudely crushed
The delicate bloom of my artistic expression.
Was that your doing, you pink menace to society?

PATRICK
Hammering? Nope. No hammers here.
Just Patrick. Standing. Breathing underwater.
That's pretty weird when you think about it.
We breathe water. But it's normal for us.
What if the water... breathed us?

[PATRICK stares blankly for a moment]

SQUIDWARD
Your mind is like an empty cave where logic
Goes to die a slow and painful death.
Just keep it down. Some of us are trying
To contribute something meaningful to civilization.

[Exit PATRICK. SQUIDWARD returns to his clarinet]

SQUIDWARD
Now, where was I? Ah yes, the bridge passage,
Where emotion transcends the mundane and touches truth.

[He plays briefly before another BANG interrupts]

For Neptune's sake! Must genius always suffer?

[SQUIDWARD storms to the window]

SQUIDWARD
Patrick! I know that's you! Confess your crimes
Against harmony and artistic pursuit!

PATRICK
[Appearing suddenly]
Crimes? I didn't steal anything! Except maybe
That cookie from the cookie jar. But that was yesterday.
Or was it tomorrow? Time is confusing.

SQUIDWARD
I'm not accusing you of theft, you simple-minded starfish!
I'm accusing you of making that infernal racket!

PATRICK
What's a racket? Is that like a tennis thing?
I don't play tennis. No arms, see?
[Waves his stubby appendages]
Just little flipper things. Not good for tennis.

[SQUIDWARD groans dramatically]

SQUIDWARD
Just. Be. Quiet.

[Exit PATRICK again. SQUIDWARD returns to his clarinet, plays three notes before the loudest BANG yet]

That's it! The final thread of my patience has snapped!

[SQUIDWARD storms outside, then returns dragging PATRICK, who is poorly hiding a hammer behind his back]

SQUIDWARD
Explain this implement of destruction I found
Clutched in your ignorant grasp! You've been lying!

PATRICK
It's not destruction, Squidward. It's creation!
I'm practicing too. My hammer is my instrument.
You have your noisy stick thing. I have my hammer.
Both make sounds. Both make... something.
Mine makes houses. Yours makes... sad whale noises?

SQUIDWARD
How dare you compare your primitive pounding
To the refined eloquence of classical clarinet!
My instrument speaks the language of the soul,
Expressing truths too profound for simple words.
Your hammer is just... a tool for the unimaginative.

PATRICK
But my hammer builds things that last.
Your music stops when you stop playing.
My house will be there tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.
What will your music build that anyone can see?

SQUIDWARD
[Taken aback]
Not all value must be visible to the uncultured eye.
My art shapes minds, elevates thoughts, transforms hearts.
When I am dust, my recordings will still move listeners to tears.
What will your hammer leave behind but splinters?

PATRICK
My hammer makes homes where memories live.
Where starfish dream and friends laugh together.
Your music keeps people away. You play alone.
I build with others. Which one is really lonely?

[Both characters face the audience, each holding their instrument]

SQUIDWARD
My clarinet, extension of my very soul,
Voice when words fail, companion in solitude.
Through you, I touch immortality's distant shore,
And leave my mark upon time's endless canvas.

PATRICK
My hammer, solid friend that never judges me,
You build the spaces where life actually happens.
Simple, yes, but true as the tide's eternal pull.
What good is beauty if nobody's there to share it?

[They look at each other, momentarily understanding the other's perspective]

SQUIDWARD
Perhaps there's room for both creation and expression.

PATRICK
Yeah! Your noise and my banging! Best friends!

[PATRICK enthusiastically raises his hammer as SQUIDWARD winces]

SQUIDWARD
I wouldn't go that far.

[Exeunt]
