# Processed Chunks Data

This directory should contain the following files required for the app to function:

- `lines.json` - Line-level chunks from Shakespeare texts
- `phrases.json` - Phrase-level chunks
- `fragments.json` - Fragment-level chunks

## Download Instructions

Due to their size (200+ MB), these files are stored externally:

1. Download from: [Your Dropbox link]
2. Place the files in this directory
3. Verify the files are present before running the app

## Alternative: Run the chunking process

If you don't want to download the files, you can generate them yourself by running the chunking scripts (requires the cleaned Shakespeare texts).
