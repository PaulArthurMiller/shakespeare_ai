# To Squid or not to Squid

ACT I

SCENE 1

[Leila and Edgar stand close in the corridor, their voices low]

LEILA
The sun grows bright, yet darkness clouds the court.
Have you observed the king's most recent rage?
His temper flares at shadows on the wall,
At whispers that his rule might someday fade.
I fear the weight of crown has bent his mind
Toward thoughts that reason cannot navigate.

EDGAR
I've seen it too... the way his eyes now search
For traitors in the faces of his friends.
Last night he called me to his chamber late
And spoke of monuments that touch the sky,
Of histories rewritten in his name...
As if tomorrow's judgment haunts today.

LEILA
We stand as pillars to support his throne,
Yet pillars crumble when the ground gives way.
Your father served as counselor before—
What wisdom did he share about such times?

EDGAR
My father kept his counsel close, and died
With secrets locked behind his silent lips.
Sometimes I think... I wonder if he knew...
That silence has a price we all must pay.

LEILA
The council meeting starts within the hour.
Will you support my motion for restraint?
The eastern campaign drains our treasury—
The people suffer while we build his dream.

EDGAR
I'll stand with you, though standing feels like falling
When caught between the truth and loyalty.
Your voice gives strength to mine when courage fails.

[He reaches for her hand, their fingers briefly intertwining]

LEILA
In this stone fortress where the walls have ears,
We steal these moments like forbidden fruit.

[Alastor enters; Leila and Edgar step apart quickly]

ALASTOR
What fortunate encounter greets my eyes!
The kingdom's brightest minds in deep discourse.
I trust I'm not intruding on affairs
Of state—or matters somewhat more... personal?

EDGAR
Just morning pleasantries, Lord Alastor.
We spoke of... council matters, nothing more.

ALASTOR
Of course. The council weighs on all our minds.
Our king expects solutions, not excuses.
The future calls us forward, bold and bright.
Why look behind when glory waits ahead?

LEILA
Some lessons hide in shadows of the past.
The eastern war consumes our nation's strength
While children hunger in the western plains.
Is this the legacy our king should build?

ALASTOR
You speak of hunger? Lady Leila, please—
Our granaries are fuller than before.
The people prosper under royal rule.
Your sentiments, though touching, miss the mark.

LEILA
Statistics without context tell false tales.
I've walked among the common folk and seen
Their struggles firsthand, not through ledger books.
The king builds monuments while bridges fall.

ALASTOR
Our king builds future, not mere monuments!
His vision stretches far beyond our sight.
Sometimes a surgeon's cut must first draw blood
Before the body heals to greater strength.
The eastern campaign secures trade routes vital
To decades of prosperity ahead.
You lack the scope to see beyond today.

EDGAR
Perhaps there's truth in both perspectives here...
The king's ambitions and the people's needs
Might find some balance if we work as one.

ALASTOR
Balance? A curious word from Chamberlain's son.
Your father understood that power demands
Decisive action, not hesitant compromise.
He'd stand beside our king without question.

EDGAR
My father served the crown with all his heart,
But even he would question paths that lead
Through darkness without promise of the dawn.
I wonder, Lord Alastor, would you speak
So boldly of the king's design if he
Were standing in this corridor with us?

ALASTOR
[with a sharp laugh]
Unlike some present, I've the king's full trust.
My counsel reaches his receptive ear
Without the filter of excessive caution.
The king and I see eye to eye on matters
That shape the kingdom's place in history.

LEILA
And there it lies—the core of our concern.
Not just today's decisions, but how time
Will judge the actions taken in our name.
The king obsesses over how he'll be
Remembered when his mortal frame has failed.
Death haunts him like a shadow at midday,
And drives him toward increasingly desperate acts.

ALASTOR
Death haunts us all, but great men rise above
Such common fear to grasp immortality.
Our king will carve his name in history's stone.
Is that not worth some temporary strain?

LEILA
At what price, Alastor? Tell me that.
When logic stands divorced from wisdom's heart,
The calculations yield a false result.
I've watched our king dismiss all voices save
Those echoing his own. Power isolates—
First from dissent, then truth, then finally self.

EDGAR
The eastern border could be secured through
Diplomacy instead of costly war.
My father's papers show alternative paths...

ALASTOR
[interrupting]
Your father's papers! Ancient history!
The world has changed since he laid down his pen.
Our enemies grow stronger by the day.
The king sees clearly what you two cannot:
A kingdom standing still soon falls behind.
Progress demands we sometimes sacrifice
The comfort of today for future's gain.

LEILA
Progress without compassion is no progress.
It's merely motion, heartless and unmoored.
The king speaks often of his legacy,
But what is legacy if not the lives
Improved by choices we make here today?

ALASTOR
Such pretty sentiments from pretty lips.
The council chamber is no place for dreams.
Reality demands pragmatic minds.
The king has chosen action over words—
As those who wish to keep their influence should.

[He looks meaningfully at Edgar]

Some family legacies hang by fragile threads.
Your father's name still carries weight, for now.
How would he view his son's... associations?

EDGAR
[stiffening]
Speak plainly, Lord Alastor, if you dare.
My loyalty remains beyond reproach.

ALASTOR
Loyalty wears many faces, my young friend.
The king values those who stand firmly with him,
Not those who whisper doubts in shadowed halls.
I merely offer friendly observation
That certain company might cloud one's judgment.

[Bells sound in the distance]

The council bell. Our king awaits our presence.
Remember as we enter those grand doors:
History remembers those who shape events,
Not those who stand aside in fear or doubt.
The king writes our tomorrow with bold strokes—
We merely choose if we'll hold the pen with him
Or be forgotten footnotes to his reign.

[Alastor bows slightly and exits toward the council chamber]

LEILA
He weaves his threats like silk into his words.
The king's ear bends too often to his voice.

EDGAR
What choice remains for us but to proceed
With caution, knowing watchful eyes observe?
I cannot break the chain of father's name,
Yet cannot blind myself to what unfolds.

LEILA
Then we must be the conscience they ignore—
The voice of those whose suffering goes unheard.
If we stay silent now, we write ourselves
Into the darkest chapters of this tale.

EDGAR
My father chose his silence, to his grave.
I've often wondered what he might have stopped
Had he found courage when it mattered most.
I'll not repeat his error, though it means
My name may fall from favor with the crown.

LEILA
Together then, we'll speak truth to this power,
Though isolation be the price we pay.
The king may write the history he desires,
But truth has patience longer than his reign.

EDGAR
The council waits. Let's face what comes ahead.
Not separate shadows, but as one light—
Though hidden from the watchful eyes at court.

[Edgar offers his arm formally to Leila]

LEILA
[taking his arm]
In public, just advisors sharing thoughts.
In private, hearts aligned against the dark.
The marble halls may echo with our steps,
But cannot hear the beating of our hearts.

[They exit toward the council chamber]
