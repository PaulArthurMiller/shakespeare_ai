ACT I

SCENE 1

[A modern coffee shop. CHARACTER1 sits alone, formally dressed, reading a newspaper. CHARACTER2 enters, dressed casually.]

CHARACTER1
One cannot help but notice the decline
In proper social conduct nowadays.
The world has changed, and not for better ways.

CHARACTER2
Hey, lighten up! Life's short, why waste your time
On all that stuffy talk? Just chill, it's fine!

CHARACTER1
Perhaps in your world, standards mean so little.
But some of us prefer a life less brittle.

[CHARACTER2 sits down uninvited at CHARACTER1's table.]

CHARACTER2
Whatever. Got an extra chair right here.
Mind if I join? The place is packed, that's clear.

CHARACTER1
[Sighs]
As if my preference would alter your course.
Please, do proceed with minimal remorse.

[They continue their awkward interaction as the scene ends.]
