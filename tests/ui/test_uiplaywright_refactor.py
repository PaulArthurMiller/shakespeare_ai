One cannot help but notice the decline
In proper social conduct nowadays.
The world has changed, and not for better ways.

CHARACTER2
Hey, lighten up! Life's short, why waste your time
On all that stuffy talk? Just chill, it's fine!

CHARACTER1
Perhaps in your world, standards mean so little.
But some of us prefer a life less brittle.

[CHARACTER2 sits down uninvited at CHARACTER1's table.]

CHARACTER2
Whatever. Got an extra chair right here.
Mind if I join? The place is packed, that's clear.

CHARACTER1

As if my preference would alter your course.
Please, do proceed with minimal remorse.
