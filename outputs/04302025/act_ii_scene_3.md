| Who can be wise whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest | THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (II.III.114), THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (III.III.85) | Who understood that wisdom isn't found |
| Set them into confounding odds, that makes these odds all even. | THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS (IV.III.399), MEASURE FOR MEASURE (III.I.41) | In cold equations and predicted odds? |

| I 'd have it come to question of what we are | THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (I.III.13), KING RICHARD THE SECOND (V.I.19) | I'd have you question what we're becoming. |
| You precious winners all; your exultation together with thy victory | A WINTER'S TALE (V.III.162), THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (V.III.121) | These victories you celebrate so proudly— |
| Have you thought on their heads to their foundations? | A WINTER'S TALE (IV.IV.582), THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (IV.I.59) | Have you considered what they're built upon? |
| Tis policy and stratagem Of his superior Since they do better thee in their command. | THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (II.I.111), TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (I.III.134), PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (IV.VI.137) | They're built on logic, on superior strategy. |
| Those darker humours that in darkness rain and cold their cold intent, tenor, and substance, thus: | THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (V.III.65), THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (II.I.8), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (IV.I.10) | They're built on something darker, something colder. |
| He 's opposite to humanity, who understandeth thee not | THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS (I.I.293), LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST (IV.II.85) | The Djinn doesn't understand humanity— |
| He that runs fastest gets the nearest way. Is this winning? | THE TAMING OF THE SHREW (I.I.131), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (IV.IV.477), THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (V.III.163) | It calculates the fastest path to winning |

| Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me. My conscience tells me you are innocent. | KING RICHARD THE THIRD (I.IV.112), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (III.I.141) | Leila, listen. I haven't lost my conscience. |
| I question with my jealous thought, in desire to question them further. | THE SONNETS (I.57.9), THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (I.V.3) | I question everything, especially the Djinn. |
| I neither can nor will deny, but notwithstanding with my personal eye, as doubtful whether what I see be true. | ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (V.III.182), THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (II.III.5), THE MERCHANT OF VENICE (III.II.151) | But I can't deny the results before my eyes— |
| With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living, the scars of battle 'scapeth by the flight, or with light skirmishes enfeebled. | CYMBELINE (V.III.14), A LOVER'S COMPLAINT (I.I.244), THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (I.IV.69) | Fewer dead, faster healing, enemy retreats. |
| I will plead against it with my life? To save this brother's life? | MEASURE FOR MEASURE (IV.II.159), MEASURE FOR MEASURE (II.IV.69) | How can I argue against saving lives? |
| Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause, which can not in their huge and proper life, no certain life achiev'd by others' death. | THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (IV.IV.65), THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH (V.PROLOGUE.5), THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (IV.II.106) | Because some lives can't be measured in numbers. |
| Disgraced me in my happy victories, the victor has the loss. | THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (IV.III.104), THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (V.IV.132) | Some victories destroy the very thing |
| We mean to fight I mean our preservation, few in millions | THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (IV.I.14), THE TEMPEST (II.I.7) | We're fighting to preserve. Our humanity |
| A thing slipped idly from me, as water in a sieve, into our hands | THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS (I.I.26), MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING (V.I.6), AS YOU LIKE IT (III.I.10) | Is slipping through our fingers like fine sand, |
| I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips, brief in hand | THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH (III.I.31), THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (IV.III.166) | And you stand watching, clipboard in hand, |
| It falls right, and in falling, which when it falls. | THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (IV.VII.77), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (I.IV.18), THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (III.III.21) | Recording how efficiently it falls. |
| That 's not so good. I am not fair. Well, I must do't. | THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (III.III.22), AS YOU LIKE IT (III.III.24), THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (III.II.133) | That's not fair. I'm doing what I must. |

| but your silence of my father grows strong in me | THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (III.I.65), AS YOU LIKE IT (I.I.52) | Your silence has become your father's strength. |
| As for your spiteful false objections, proceed by swallowing that down thy ill-uttering throat. | THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (I.III.145), CYMBELINE (III.V.71), THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (II.V.41) | Each time you swallow your objections, |

| You confine yourself most unreasonably; of your philosophy you make no use. | THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (I.III.67), THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (IV.III.161) | You're isolating yourself behind logic, |
| Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason when walls are so wilful to hear without warning | THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (I.IV.30), A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (V.I.205) | Building walls of reason without windows |
| To seek out sorrow that dwells everywhere. | KING RICHARD THE SECOND (I.II.72) | To see the suffering outside. |
| For I do see the cruel pangs of death where I am drowned | THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (V.IV.60), THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA (I.III.80) | You think I don't see suffering? I drown in it! |
| Why, here walk I in the black brow of night, I have some wounds upon me. | THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (V.VI.20), THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (I.IX.31) | Each night I walk among the wounded, Leila. |
| Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know the worthiest of them tell me name by name; alas, poor souls, it grieved my heart to hear what pitiful cries they | THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (V.I.7), TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (IV.V.180), PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (II.I.20) | I hear their cries, I know their names, their stories. |
| Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves. But none can help our harms by wailing them. | TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (III.III.239), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (II.II.103) | But wishes won't heal wounds or win this war. |
| And reason coldly of your grievances, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find | THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET (III.I.43), THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (II.II.340) | The Djinn's cold logic offers something real— |
| To bring this matter to the wished end for once for all and ever. | THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (III.III.28), KING RICHARD THE SECOND (II.II.149) | A path to end this bloodshed once for all. |

| Stand all apart, and here he stands, each man apart, all single and alone, | KING RICHARD THE SECOND (III.III.190), THE MERCHANT OF VENICE (V.I.180), THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS (V.I.108) | See how he stands alone now, separate, |
| How well supplied with noble counsellors, imprisoned and in scarcity of friends. | THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH (II.IV.35), THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS (II.II.232) | Surrounded by advisors yet isolated |
| By wicked powers, like power divine. | A WINTER'S TALE (V.III.112), MEASURE FOR MEASURE (V.I.383) | By power that depends on Djinn alone. |
| Is this your promise, Eve's legacy, well chosen to build upon? | THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (IV.I.105), THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA (III.I.320), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (I.IV.53) | Is that the legacy you wish to build? |
