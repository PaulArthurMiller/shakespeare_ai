| And confident from foreign purposes, Of hostile arms | THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (II.I.28), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (IV.IV.412) | Not from the blows of enemies abroad |
| But when we in our viciousness grow hard— From the corruption of abusing times | THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (III.XIII.135), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (III.VII.198) | But from the moral decay we cultivate |
| A heart unfortified, without controlment, justice, or revenge? | THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (I.II.99), THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (II.I.70) | When power stands alone, unchecked by heart. |

| in their chamber You sign your place and calling, in full seeming, | THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (II.I.21), KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (II.IV.116) | Isolated in their chambers, signing names |
| There is pretty orders beginning strange screams of death | MEASURE FOR MEASURE (II.I.199), THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (II.III.51) | To orders that transform to screaming death. |

| I am here. And so I am. I am. | THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET (I.III.7), THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (IV.VII.82) | But I was here. I am the bridge between |

| More out of malice than integrity, of that integrity which should become't | KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (V.II.213), THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (III.I.191) | But something more—integrity, perhaps, |
