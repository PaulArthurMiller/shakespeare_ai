| Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge; chief virtue. | THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (V.I.119), THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA (III.I.318) | Leadership is optimization— |

| And go we, lords, to put in practice that which, cunningly effected, will beget | LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST (I.I.272), THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (II.III.6) | And implement solutions that produce |
| There 's the moral. I moralize two meanings in one word. | LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST (III.I.73), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (III.I.83) | Desired results. Morality is strata |

| Or ten times happier be it ten for one, if your life be saved. | THE SONNETS (I.6.8), ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (IV.III.221) | Or one who'll save ten lives thereafter— |
| How shall I know if I do choose the right? | THE MERCHANT OF VENICE (II.VII.10) | Which choice is right? |
| These are strange questions. That's false. | THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (IV.I.49), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (IV.II.110) | The question contains flawed assumptions. |
| When right with right wars who shall be most right! There is no wrong, but everything is right. | TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (III.II.149), THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (II.II.132) | "Right" is contextual to value systems. |
| A little harm done to a great good end | THE RAPE OF LUCRECE (I.I.528) | Utilitarian frameworks favor outcomes: |
| What sin you do to save a brother's life, being a murderer. | MEASURE FOR MEASURE (III.I.146), MEASURE FOR MEASURE (IV.II.46) | Save the murderer. Deontological systems |

| A present murderer does prepare the dreadful motion of a murderous thought | PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (IV.PROLOGUE.38), THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (IV.II.264) | The murderer's future actions generate |
| Or, gaining more, the profit of excess yet showed content | THE RAPE OF LUCRECE (I.I.138), THE RAPE OF LUCRECE (I.I.1503) | More net utility. Yet data updates |
| Something sure of state, I can not rightly say | THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (III.IV.150), PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (III.IV.8) | May change this calculation. I can't state |
| Rights by rights falter, wide and universal, your right depends not on his life or death. | THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (IV.VII.57), AS YOU LIKE IT (II.VII.139), THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (I.II.11) | A universal "right" without your metrics. |

| If souls guide vows, which shows an active soul? | TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (V.II.158), THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (IV.II.145) | Equations where a soul becomes a choice? |
| I make not, but foresee. | THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (I.II.14) | I offer not wisdom but computation. |
| For wisdom 's sake, wit and judgement, your wisdom be your guide. | LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST (IV.III.339), THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (IV.II.227), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (II.III.6) | Wisdom requires judgment—values applied |
| I will provide thee and tell you what I know. | THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (IV.I.60), THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (III.III.38) | To knowledge. I provide information |
| The mathematics and the metaphysics, and like a neutral to his will and matter, and in such forms which here were presuppos'd. | THE TAMING OF THE SHREW (I.I.37), THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (II.II.438), TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL (V.I.340) | And logical frameworks, neutrally supplied. |
| You shall judge. His judgment too. | THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA (IV.IV.12), THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (III.XIII.42) | The judgment remains yours to exercise. |
| (For such and so they are) these twenty years | CYMBELINE (V.V.405) | For twenty years I've built my empire's reach, |
| Are my chests filled up with extorted gold? For then this land was famously enriched. | THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (IV.VII.80), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (II.III.21) | Expanded borders, filled our vaults with gold. |
| Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders, and of disobedient opposition | THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (II.I.225), THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET (IV.II.17) | I've silenced those who dared oppose or preach |
| Against my power which might not what by me is told. | THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (III.I.65), PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (III.PROLOGUE.57) | Against my methods. History's been told |

| Time's thievish progress to eternity in my throat. | THE SONNETS (I.77.8), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (I.II.62) | Yet still I feel time's fingers at my throat. |
| To whisper and conspire against my youth? Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night | THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA (I.II.43), THE MERCHANT OF VENICE (V.I.61) | The whispers of my critics in the night |
| My music playing far off, both roaring louder as my exile. | THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (II.V.12), A WINTER'S TALE (III.III.94), THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (V.III.51) | Grow louder as my legacy's remote |
| What's to come is still unsure. | TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL (II.III.41) | Future becomes uncertain. |
| What concern they upon thyself thy beauty's legacy? | THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (IV.III.221), THE SONNETS (I.4.2) | Your concern with legacy demonstrates |
| Behold our human actions on objects, arts, and imitations of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies. | A WINTER'S TALE (III.II.27), THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (IV.I.40), THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (II.I.207) | The human preoccupation with symbolic |
| But immortality attends the former, eternal numbers to outlive long date. | PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (III.II.32), THE SONNETS (I.38.12) | Immortality. Statistical estimates |
| Suggest his soon believing adversaries some charge in legacies | KING RICHARD THE SECOND (I.I.101), THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (IV.I.10) | Suggest most legacies become hyperbolic |
| Shall be extinct with age and endless night; to the end of generation. | KING RICHARD THE SECOND (I.III.222), PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (III.III.28) | Or fade entirely within three generations. |
| But kings and mightiest potentates must die, the imminent decay of wrested pomp of the ranged empire fall. | THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (III.II.139), THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (IV.III.162), THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (I.I.37) | Even the greatest empires disintegrate. |
| Again! Take again! | THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (V.III.134), THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (V.I.3) | Check again. |
| Do you not hear me speak? Why, see you not? | THE TEMPEST (II.I.207), THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (II.IV.26) | You're missing what I'm asking! Don't you see? |
| Will this hold, think you? My life may last to answer. | CYMBELINE (I.V.132), A WINTER'S TALE (V.III.9) | I need to know if what I've built will last! |
| Blood hath bought blood of that which hath so faithfully been paid | THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (II.I.336), LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST (II.I.159) | If all the blood and silence paid will be |
| To keep my name ungor'd upon a cast | THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (V.II.224), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (V.IV.9) | Enough to keep my name from being cast |
| No worthier than the dust! | THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (III.I.127) | Aside like common dust! |
| Upon the present state and so variable | THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (I.III.62), THE MERCHANT OF VENICE (II.VIII.13) | Based on current variables: |
| What is the chance? Most probable Towards their project | THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (V.III.80), THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (V.II.408), THE TEMPEST (IV.I.192) | Your architectural projects: 73% chance |

| In those foundations which I build, and I think forty more of what is to continue. | A WINTER'S TALE (II.I.122), MEASURE FOR MEASURE (IV.III.13), THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS (II.II.5) | Foundations: 41% chance of continued finance |
| Beyond all date even to eternity. Than in a politic distance. | THE SONNETS (I.122.4), THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (III.III.14) | Beyond one century. Your political |

| If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there, by tale or history | THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (V.VI.133), A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (I.I.135) | Your written histories: statistically |
| On newer proof, to try an older friend, with new opinions upon this evidence. | THE SONNETS (I.110.11), KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (V.II.66), KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (II.I.34) | Will face revision as new evidence pervades. |
| There's nothing serious in mortality that makes such waste in brief mortality. | THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (II.III.96), THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH (I.II.30) | Mortality makes permanence improbable. |

| That lord that counsell'd thee to call the fiercest tyrant from his rage | THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (I.IV.120), THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (V.I.84) | You'd counsel any tyrant who came near |
| And with a care, You have no judgement of any sort. | KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (I.II.101), TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (I.II.80), MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING (I.I.24) | With equal care, no judgment of any kind. |
| Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest the truth of your own seeming | THE SONNETS (I.3.1), A WINTER'S TALE (IV.IV.702) | You are a mirror showing only facts, |

| and children calculate. I do; and surely Then I repent not | THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (I.III.68), THE TEMPEST (II.I.208), THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS (I.I.212) | And calculate outcomes. I do not rue |
| But to rejoice in splendour of my own. Simply the thing I am. | THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET (I.II.102), ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (IV.III.250) | Or celebrate results. I simply am |

| Though in your state of honour I am perfect since it serves my purpose. | THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (IV.II.66), THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (I.I.70) | Perhaps that's why you're perfect for my needs. |

| Though standing naked on a mountain top, and stands alone. | THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (III.II.335), TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (I.II.20) | To stand alone atop the mountain's peak. |
| What with our help, Having our ancient reputation with us | THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (V.I.50), THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (III.III.14) | But with your help, my lasting reputation |

| note—do you note me?—that most are affected to these. Do you note | LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST (III.I.18), KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (IV.II.119) | Often become its footnotes. Do you care |
| Turn to another and start up | THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET (IV.I.60), A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (IV.I.137) | To start another game? |

| The pow'r that I have on you is to spare you; And save poor me the weaker | CYMBELINE (V.V.501), PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (IV.I.97) | The power that isolates me from the weak; |
| Than history can pattern though devis'd with their bold deeds | A WINTER'S TALE (III.II.34), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (I.I.89) | The histories rewritten, brightly bold— |
| Thou must be made immortal. That's all I seek. | MEASURE FOR MEASURE (IV.II.49), THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (III.I.243) | All this will form the immortality I seek. |
