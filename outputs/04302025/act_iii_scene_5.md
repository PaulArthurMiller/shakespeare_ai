| Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read these antique fables | THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (I.III.70), A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (V.I.3) | Look here, Alastor! These ancient texts— |
| Thou speakest wonders if knowledge could be set up that mend upon the world. | KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (V.IV.60), ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (I.I.23), CYMBELINE (II.IV.28) | They speak of knowledge that could remake our world! |
| No, no, they were not bound as they to claim. | THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (II.IV.143), THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (III.II.99) | The Djinn weren't demons as the Council claims, |
| These are their tutors, where truth is hid, preservers of my throne. | THE TAMING OF THE SHREW (II.I.108), THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (II.II.164), CYMBELINE (V.V.2) | But teachers, guardians of forgotten truths. |
| Your wisdoms could not discover as one with treasure laden, buried some dear friend. | MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING (V.I.215), VENUS AND ADONIS (I.I.1022), THE COMEDY OF ERRORS (V.I.50) | Their wisdom waits like buried treasure, friend, |
| And underneath that consecrated roof, the disgrace we have digested being fed by us. | TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL (IV.III.25), THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH (III.VI.103), THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (V.I.60) | Just underneath the dogma we've been fed. |

| And list what with our council we have done to points that seem impossible. | KING RICHARD THE SECOND (I.III.124), PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (V.I.135) | Connected dots the Council chose to miss. |

| Would you imagine, or almost believe, what a world is this, the common people. | KING RICHARD THE THIRD (III.V.35), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (II.I.84), THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (II.III.80) | Imagine it—a world where common folk |

| Or do you almost think, although you see, it must be your imagination then, and not theirs. | THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (IV.III.43), A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (V.I.209) | That's what they want you thinking, don't you see? |
| The people will remain uncertain whilst such creatures as men doubt | THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (V.VI.21), THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (II.I.137) | The Council thrives on keeping us in doubt. |
| Look, here it is. | THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (III.III.347) | But look— |

| Or else new form'd 'em: having both the key | THE TEMPEST (I.II.98) | The Djinn left us a universal key, |
| to put those pow'rs in motion whose powers are these | CYMBELINE (IV.III.36), THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (IV.IV.10) | A way to unlock powers they possessed. |

| Think but this, and all is mended, What if it should be so? | A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (V.I.399), THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS (III.IV.110) | But think about it—what if everything, |
| This is the very top, which is the ladder of all high designs, to those above us. | THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (IV.III.45), TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (I.III.103), THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (V.I.5) | The very structure of our hierarchy, |
| No it was builded far from accident, with lies well steeled with weighty arguments. | THE SONNETS (I.124.5), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (I.I.151) | Was built on calculated, curated lies? |

| Chaos is come again? Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement! | THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (III.III.102), THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (III.I.89) | Not chaos, no! A liberation, yes! |

| Ere you had spoke so far a very rebel to my will | THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (V.III.70), THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (IV.IX.17) | Before you spoke your first rebellious thought. |
| Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days, when you were boys | THE SONNETS (I.70.9), A WINTER'S TALE (I.II.73) | The Council saw your path when you were young, |
| Feed yourselves with questioning; Your dangerous lenity. | AS YOU LIKE IT (V.IV.118), THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (III.I.125) | Your questioning mind, your dangerous empathy. |
| And watch'd the time to shoot. We'll wait upon you. We'll lead you thither. | ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (V.III.13), THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (II.II.262), AS YOU LIKE IT (IV.III.164) | We watched and waited, let you lead us to |

| I 'll follow you that lay scattered by | A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (III.I.85), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (I.IV.33) | Now I'll collect these breadcrumbs you've laid out, |
| The map of honour and marked you both with a power | THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (III.I.203), LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST (IV.III.133), THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (IV.IV.61) | These maps to power you've conveniently marked. |

| To scatter 'em as 'tis to make 'em sleep Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered. | KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (V.III.10), THE SONNETS (I.124.4) | Not scatter them like seeds among the weeds. |
| But since correction lieth in those hands with instruments upon them fit to open | KING RICHARD THE SECOND (I.II.4), THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET (V.III.208) | Such tools belong in hands that understand |
| Authority so weighty, the price of this inkle, that makes the weight. | KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (III.II.284), LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST (III.I.116), THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (IV.XV.42) | The weight of power, the price of wielding it. |

| Yes, my good lord; a pure unspotted heart, sure some scape. | THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (V.III.189), A WINTER'S TALE (III.III.72) | Yes, Leila. Perfect scapegoat, |
| Yet most suspected, with some suspicion. | THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET (V.III.232), THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH (II.II.141) | Already viewed with suspicion by most. |
| She puts on outward strangeness, for her keeping close, between you both | VENUS AND ADONIS (I.I.310), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (IV.II.55), THE COMEDY OF ERRORS (I.II.84) | Her foreign ways, her closeness to you both— |
| It appears so by the story without the help of any hand at all. | THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (III.III.133), THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (IV.I.72) | The story writes itself with little help. |
| She comes to you in a rage, with any passion of inflaming love, | TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (V.II.4), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (I.I.143), THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (V.V.82) | She came to you in passion or in rage, |
