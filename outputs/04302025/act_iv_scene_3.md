| That would make good of bad, and friends of foes! Now my sworn friend, and then mine enemy; | THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (II.IV.52), A WINTER'S TALE (I.II.199) | Good. When enemies become allies and allies enemies, |

| That never erring arbitrator to the arbitrement | THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (I.II.131), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (V.III.93) | The probability of your emergence as arbiter |

| Why this is just. Simple of itself. Nothing, but this is so. | THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (I.IV.58), THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR (III.V.23), THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (I.III.87) | This is simply efficient. Nothing more. |

| Beyond what can be valu'd, much beyond our thoughts | THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (I.I.50), THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (I.IV.33) | Something beyond your calculations. |
| These many then shall die; their names are prick'd. Must die tomorrow. | THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (IV.I.1), MEASURE FOR MEASURE (II.III.44) | These men who'll die tomorrow—thousands of them— |
| Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb? and then they dream of love | THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (IV.V.34), THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET (I.IV.75) | Each carried a mother's hopes, a lover's dreams. |

| And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by in other men | KING RICHARD THE THIRD (I.IV.33), THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS (V.I.31) | On the crushed bones of other men's futures? |
| I shall as famous be by this exploit | THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (II.III.5) | Will history remember the brilliance of my strategy |
| Or bathe my dying honour in the blood And to survey the bodies of the dead? Was this ambition? | THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (IV.II.8), THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (IV.VII.57), THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (III.II.96) | Or count the corpses that paid for my ambition? |
| You orphan heirs of fixed destiny | THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR (V.V.31) | Legacy is a human preoccupation. |
| It is no matter which way you shall go; it will help nothing. | TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (V.II.80), CYMBELINE (V.IV.180), KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (I.I.243) | It has no bearing on the optimal path forward. |
| Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead, that feel it. The same dead thing alive. | MEASURE FOR MEASURE (I.III.29), THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET (I.I.22), CYMBELINE (V.V.145) | The dead feel no pain. The living adapt. |
| Why do we linger thus? Nothing is done to purpose. Being done, there is no pause. | THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (I.II.32), THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (III.I.181), THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (V.II.98) | This hesitation serves no practical purpose. |
| His powerful mandate to you: "Do this or this;" how with most advantage | THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (I.I.24), THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (I.IV.12) | Your instructions were clear: maximum advantage |
| And yet the spacious breadth of this division. Well have we done. | TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (V.II.169), THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH (IV.VI.1) | Through strategic division. We have achieved this. |
| Why should I not now have the like success? question your desires Of our design | THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (I.II.75), A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (I.I.69), THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (IV.VII.9) | Why question the success of your own design? |
| Thus must I from the smoke into the smother, where either I must live or bear no life! | AS YOU LIKE IT (I.II.234), THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (IV.II.66) | Because I must live with myself when the smoke clears! |
| To give thee nightly visitation. | TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (IV.IV.75) | Because each night these faces visit me— |
| No, no, men living flatter those that die. | KING RICHARD THE SECOND (II.I.89) | Not the faces of the dead, but of those who will die. |
| What men have I but never saw before; of whom I have, which never shall be known | THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (I.II.22), THE TEMPEST (V.I.222), PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (IV.I.2) | Men I've never met, whose names I'll never know, |
| Those heavenly eyes that look into these faults | LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST (V.II.769) | Looking at me with eyes that somehow understand |
| I am the cause to their end | ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (III.II.112), THE SONNETS (I.60.2) | That I am the author of their end. |
| But I can not choose but what shall I do? | THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (IV.V.66), THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (III.IV.198) | But what choice do I have now? |
| The wheel is come full circle already at a point, was setting forth. | THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (V.III.203), THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (IV.III.148) | The wheel is already turning. |
| To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me, it stops me here; And woo your own destruction. | KING RICHARD THE THIRD (IV.II.62), THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (II.I.208), KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (V.I.165) | To stop it would mean my own destruction. |
| If one should be a prey, how much the better and we survive as a monster | TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL (III.I.113), THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (I.I.133), A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (II.II.96) | Better to be the monster who survives |
| As with a saint Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life, Where stain'd nobility lies trodden on | MEASURE FOR MEASURE (I.IV.39), THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (IV.III.65), THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (V.IV.12) | Than the saint crushed beneath history's march. |
| Take your choice of those; there's but two ways; you must perforce accomplish as you may. | THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (I.VI.78), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (V.III.94), THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (II.I.114) | Your alternatives are limited but exist. |

| As then the messenger could reach them | MEASURE FOR MEASURE (V.I.83), ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (II.I.74) | A messenger could still reach them |
| Before the sun shall see's, we'll spill the blood. Behold another day break in the east. | THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (IV.VIII.4), THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (V.IV.33) | Before dawn breaks. The eastern coalition |
| being thus forewarned in the world 's false forgeries | THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (IV.I.113), THE PASSIONATE PILGRIM (I.I.4) | Could be warned of the forgery. |
| Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life. | THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA (III.I.245) | The probability of your survival would decrease |
| Sixty and nine that wore. Assay the power you have. Thy power had lost his power. | TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (I.PROLOGUE.5), MEASURE FOR MEASURE (I.IV.83), VENUS AND ADONIS (I.I.944) | By sixty-three percent. Your power would diminish |
| From seventeen years till now almost fourscore. Yes. | AS YOU LIKE IT (II.III.72), THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (II.II.136) | By eighty-seven percent. But yes, |
| That would reduce these bloody days again, without much fall of blood. | KING RICHARD THE THIRD (V.V.36), THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH (I.II.27) | The bloodshed would be reduced significantly. |
| I talk not of your soul. There is a soul counts thee her creditor. | MEASURE FOR MEASURE (II.IV.61), THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (III.III.23) | You offer me numbers when I speak of souls! |
| That is the very defect of the matter, sir. You and your ways, the spirit of a fiend. | THE MERCHANT OF VENICE (II.II.107), THE TEMPEST (III.III.93), THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET (III.II.83) | This is the problem with your kind, Djinn. |
| There is no truth at all i' th' oracle: an answer will serve all men. | A WINTER'S TALE (III.II.146), ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (II.II.10) | All logic, no wisdom. All answers, no truth. |
| To catch the nearest way from point to point | THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (I.V.14), ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (III.I.1) | You see the shortest path between two points |
| But keep the hills and upper regions, and all the craggy mountains yield. | THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (V.I.3), THE PASSIONATE PILGRIM (I.I.338) | But miss the valleys and mountains between. |
| For 'tis my limited service. I am bound to serve. | THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (II.III.46), LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST (IV.I.56) | I offer what I am designed to offer. |
| Their clearer reason from that clearness | THE TEMPEST (V.I.74), THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (III.I.129) | Clarity without the fog of emotion. |
| A good direction without a burden out of doubt. | KING RICHARD THE THIRD (V.III.310), A WINTER'S TALE (I.II.3), A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (IV.II.2) | Direction without the burden of doubt. |
| Summon'd me hither to this short-grass'd green for several virtues? | THE TEMPEST (IV.I.90), THE TEMPEST (III.I.51) | You summoned me for precisely these qualities. |
| You are jealous now because they say your chang'd complexions are to me a mirror | THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (III.IV.199), THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR (IV.I.16), A WINTER'S TALE (I.II.440) | Now you resent them because they mirror |
| I tell you that which you yourselves do know, to know the thing I am forbid to know: that you did fear is done. | THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (III.II.221), LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST (I.I.60), THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (V.II.383) | What you already knew but feared to admit: |
| Allowed with absolute power by which power | THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS (V.II.54), KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (III.II.372) | That power requires isolation, |
| That greatness should so grossly offer it. | THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (IV.II.95) | That greatness demands sacrifice, |
| That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making, And we create a whole history | THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (III.IV.38), KING RICHARD THE SECOND (II.I.222), THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (III.II.273) | That history is not recorded but created. |
| And what of all this? I wonder in my soul | THE TAMING OF THE SHREW (IV.IV.86), THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (III.III.76) | And what of my soul in all this? What happens |
| Performers of this heinous bloody deed? The damned contriver of this deed! | THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (IV.I.81), THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (IV.I.36) | To the man who orchestrates such horror? |
| With some men else that think themselves as safe within the girdle of these walls | KING RICHARD THE THIRD (III.II.66), THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH (I.PROLOGUE.19) | Who sits safe behind stone walls while men |
| Shall I lay perjury upon my soul? And turn you all your hatred now on me? Tear him to pieces. | THE MERCHANT OF VENICE (IV.I.231), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (I.III.190), THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (V.VI.142) | Tear each other apart based on lies I've told? |
| His soul thou canst not have within my view. | KING RICHARD THE THIRD (I.II.48), THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (I.IX.93) | Your soul is not within my jurisdiction. |
| I have no judgement in an honest face. | THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (III.III.54) | I deal in outcomes, not judgments. |
| How probable I do not know; the blackest sin is cleared with absolution. | THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (IV.VI.82), THE RAPE OF LUCRECE (I.I.354) | In probabilities, not absolution. |
| Let me ask you one thing: which is more | PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (II.V.32), MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING (IV.II.63) | The question is simple: what matters more— |
| And there repose you for this night. | KING RICHARD THE SECOND (II.III.162) | Your comfortable sleep tonight, |
| Or fill up chronicles in time to come, if you have writ your annals true, and thy place shall be honourable. | THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (I.III.173), THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (V.VI.133), THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (II.IV.434) | Or your place in the annals of time? |
| When I was young, as yet I am not old, and my father | THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (III.IV.17), A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (IV.I.199) | When I was young, my father told me |
| A great man Men that make | A WINTER'S TALE (IV.IV.790), KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (V.II.92) | That a great man is one who makes |
| learn thou to make some meaner choice Whose great decision | THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (II.I.75), ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (III.I.3) | Difficult choices for the greater good. |
| These very words which is as dear to me as life itself, as if my trinkets had been hallowed. | KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (I.II.150), THE MERCHANT OF VENICE (IV.I.289), A WINTER'S TALE (IV.IV.658) | I've clung to those words like a talisman, |
| For mine own ends indeed that puts him to these ends. | KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (III.II.261), KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (I.I.67) | Believing that my ends justify these means. |
| What if he had said, if his cause be wrong, some achieve greatness | THE TEMPEST (II.I.67), THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH (IV.I.117), TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL (V.I.361) | But what if he was wrong? What if greatness |
| Must not be measur'd by his worth, for then | THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (V.VIII.51) | Is measured not by what we achieve, |
| But by my ruin, by wilful taste of what thyself refusest. | TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (V.III.64), THE SONNETS (I.40.8) | But by what we refuse to destroy? |
| Even by the rule of that philosophy, this is too long, too indirect for long continuance. | THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (V.I.109), THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (II.II.455), THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (IV.III.112) | This philosophical detour is inefficient. |
| Darraign your battle, for they are at hand. The period of thy tyranny approacheth. | THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (II.II.72), THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (IV.II.17) | The battle lines are drawn. Your moment approaches. |
| Seize it if thou dar'st, or cease your quest of love, by doubtful fear? | KING RICHARD THE SECOND (IV.I.49), THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (I.I.197), THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (IV.VI.62) | Will you seize it, or surrender to doubt? |
| With whom each minute threatens life or death; we breathe too long. | PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (I.III.23), THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (V.IV.14) | The window for action narrows with each breath. |
| Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then. | THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (IV.I.119) | Decide. |
| Nay, go not back. Since we have come so far, but never once again turn back. | A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (III.II.353), THE TAMING OF THE SHREW (IV.V.12), THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (II.I.185) | No. No, I've come too far to turn back now. |

| Let this dissension first be tried by fight, and let them fight, to cut one another's throats. | THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (IV.I.116), THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (IV.I.53), THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH (II.I.76) | Let the factions tear at each other's throats. |

| And when that they are dead, these famished beggars, weary of their lives, to prefer a peace | THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (V.II.199), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (V.III.338), THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (III.I.114) | And when they are exhausted, desperate for peace, |
| I will no more be hidden, nor put off. I must come forth. I shall devise something. | THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (III.VI.156), THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (V.II.295), AS YOU LIKE IT (IV.III.179) | I will emerge from the shadows with solutions, |
