| The sullen passage of thy weary steps to the marbled mansion | KING RICHARD THE SECOND (I.III.265), THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS (IV.III.205) | The marble halls may echo with our steps, |
| Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful; we cannot hear it. | THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (III.I.183), THE MERCHANT OF VENICE (V.I.70) | But cannot hear the beating of our hearts. |
