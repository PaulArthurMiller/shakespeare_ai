| How now my flesh, into this breathing world scarce half made up | CYMBELINE (V.V.309), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (I.I.21) | Now look—reduced to breathing flesh, |
| A statue than a breather. | THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (III.III.30) | A symbol rather than a man. |
| Shall that finish the jest? The promise of his wrath. | LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST (II.I.226), THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (I.II.104) | That's the final joke of power's promise: |
