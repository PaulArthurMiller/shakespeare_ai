| Make it so known that my name receives a brand | THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (IV.VI.3), THE SONNETS (I.111.5) | Make it so my name becomes synonymous |

| This proffer is absurd and reasonless. | THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (V.IV.137) | Your proposition fails on basic terms. |

| That was not forced; that never was inclined under the blow of thralled discontent, that they may crush down with a heavy fall. | THE RAPE OF LUCRECE (I.I.1657), THE SONNETS (I.124.7), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (V.III.115) | That forced narratives collapse beneath their weight. |
| What do you mean "We fail?" What I command | THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (III.VII.84), THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (I.VII.66), THE TEMPEST (I.II.432) | What do you mean "fails"? Nothing I command |

| Quenching the flame of bold rebellion in gross rebellion and detested treason. | THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (I.PROLOGUE.26), KING RICHARD THE SECOND (II.III.110) | Transformed rebellion into loyalty. |
| Which had you rather, that the most just law? Establish'd then this law a simple one. | MEASURE FOR MEASURE (II.IV.55), THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH (I.II.52), THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH (II.I.6) | Surely you can shape one simple law? |
| My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel. It strains me past the compass of my wits. | THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (IV.III.49), THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET (IV.I.48) | The parameters exceed my capabilities. |
| Have no power, for truth is truth | ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (IV.II.47), MEASURE FOR MEASURE (V.I.50) | Not from lack of power, but from truth: |

| The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe against thy deity. | THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (III.III.40), CYMBELINE (V.IV.97) | The more resistance grows against your myth. |
| I speak not this in estimation, Nay, it is possible enough to judgement! | THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (I.III.278), THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (I.III.12) | This is not judgment, merely calculation. |

| Caesar? | THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (I.II.15) | Logic? What of Caesar? Alexander? |

| For what they have not, that which they possess, and do not seek to take your change upon you, what you seek. | THE RAPE OF LUCRECE (I.I.135), AS YOU LIKE IT (I.III.97), ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (II.I.17) | They did not grasp for what you seek to hold. |
| More than their own, the action of their bodies from their souls, beyond their feeling. | THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (III.III.443), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (I.I.207), THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (IV.II.28) | Their actions spoke beyond their own desires. |
| if you be remembered To hear themselves remembered | MEASURE FOR MEASURE (II.I.95), THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (I.IX.32) | You wish to dictate how you're rememberedâ€” |
| But if thou live remembered not to be, that will never be forgot. | THE SONNETS (I.3.13), THE RAPE OF LUCRECE (I.I.536) | This paradox ensures you'll be forgot. |
| It cannot fail but by corruption wins not more than honesty. | A WINTER'S TALE (IV.IV.511), KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (III.II.519) | The algorithm cannot be corrupted: |
| Who shall be of as little memory which craves to be remembered | THE TEMPEST (II.I.237), THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS (II.II.235) | Those who most demand to be remembered |

| O, speak no more, for I have heard too much! Thou'rt poison to my blood. | THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (II.I.48), CYMBELINE (I.II.67) | Enough! Your words are poison to my ears. |
| You do blaspheme the good in mocking me. Thou aimest all awry. | MEASURE FOR MEASURE (I.IV.40), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (II.IV.59) | You twist the truth to mock my rightful aims. |

| Your deeds of war damned in the book of heaven. | THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (I.I.93), KING RICHARD THE SECOND (IV.I.240) | Your deeds are noted in the cosmic ledger. |
| More than their actions these deeds must not be thought | THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (I.I.149), THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (II.II.39) | But legacy is not a sum of actionsâ€” |
| It then remains an end, and that is all. | THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (II.II.142), THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (III.II.38) | It's what remains when calculation ends. |
| And thou in this shalt find thy monument; When sometime lofty towers I see down rased | THE SONNETS (I.107.13), THE SONNETS (I.64.3) | The monuments you've built will someday fall; |
| These dispositions, which of late transform you and recreate yourselves | THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (I.IV.197), THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (III.II.249) | The systems you've created will transform. |
| This is mere madness: cruelty. | THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (V.I.252), TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL (III.II.47) | This is not cruelty but simple math: |
| For though usurpers sway the rule awhile, outlive thy glory the other lives | THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (III.III.76), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (I.III.203), AS YOU LIKE IT (III.II.254) | All rulers fade unless their impact lives |

| Then do but say to me what I should do | THE MERCHANT OF VENICE (I.I.160) | Then tell me what I need! Don't stand there cold |
| And look on death itself! For now against himself he sounds this doom, to the ending doom. | THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (II.III.76), THE RAPE OF LUCRECE (I.I.717), THE SONNETS (I.55.12) | Like death itself, pronouncing judgment's doom. |
| With secrets climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate. | THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (IV.II.172), LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST (I.I.111) | What secret formula unlocks the gate |
| That to their everlasting residence of great name and worth | THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (II.I.290), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (IV.V.16) | To that eternal hall where great names dwell? |
| There is no answer made. for the fail. | THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH (V.II.75), A WINTER'S TALE (II.III.202) | There is no formula. That's why it fails. |
| This was sometime a paradox, and yet not so, for what can we bequeath | THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (III.I.120), KING RICHARD THE SECOND (III.II.149) | The paradox of legacy persists: |
| So run'st thou after that which flies from thee, are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd. | THE SONNETS (I.143.9), THE MERCHANT OF VENICE (II.VI.14) | Those who chase it never capture it; |
| that humble themselves may But they shall find As will to greatness dedicate themselves, | ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (IV.V.38), MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING (IV.I.200), THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (IV.III.83) | Those who serve beyond themselves might find |
| How possibly preserved; and who to thank, their names are prick'd. | PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (V.III.68), THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (IV.I.1) | Their names preserved through unintended means. |
| You would not hear me doubted, but your silence. I'll speak to thee in silence. | THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (III.I.65), CYMBELINE (V.IV.30) | Your silence might speak louder than your shouts. |
| Your absence only, more than your force. | LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST (V.II.232), AS YOU LIKE IT (II.VII.104) | Your absence might mark presence more than force. |
| This is no answer which if you shall refuse. | CYMBELINE (II.III.96), PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (II.I.67) | This is the equation you refuse to solve. |
| Tut, I came not to hear this. | THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (IV.III.95) | I did not summon you to hear riddles |
| Or else be impudently negative, most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under such colours. | A WINTER'S TALE (I.II.319), LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST (I.II.71) | Or veiled insults masked as cosmic truth! |

| And for my self mine own worth do define, what I must strive to do. | THE SONNETS (I.62.7), THE TEMPEST (III.I.25) | The worthiness of what I choose to seek. |

| This is the deadly spite that angers me, and spite of spite | THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (III.I.191), THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (II.III.5) | This is not spite but universal lawâ€” |
| As certain as I know the sun is fire, the fixed stars of heaven, yet hanging in the stars. | THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (V.IV.39), KING RICHARD THE SECOND (II.IV.9), THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET (I.IV.113) | As certain as the stars that wheel above, |
| How unremovable and fix'd he is in his gravity | THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (II.IV.94), THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (II.I.155) | As fixed as gravity that holds you down. |

| Say to me, | THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (II.III.17) | How dare you speak of loneliness to me, |
| When all the world is here to look on me? Crowd to his presence, to glance thine eye aside. | A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (II.I.230), MEASURE FOR MEASURE (II.IV.31), THE SONNETS (I.139.6) | When crowds would die to catch my passing glance? |
| And yet you will stand to it, scarce seen a light, Stand you awhile apart, | THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (III.III.127), LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST (IV.III.234), THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (IV.I.86) | Yet here you stand, alone in fading light, |
| Subjected tribute to commanding love, spirits to enforce, art to enchant; to be loved | THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (I.I.266), THE TEMPEST (V.I.375), THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (II.IV.372) | Commanding spirits to ensure you're loved. |
| The mystery of your loneliness as the other in music and mathematics | ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (I.III.146), THE TAMING OF THE SHREW (II.I.79) | The mathematics of your solitude |
| Hold thy desperate hand. Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands. | THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET (III.III.112), KING RICHARD THE SECOND (II.I.192) | Compute precisely with your desperate grasp. |
| The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp | THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH (IV.I.227) | The throne that elevates you separates |
| In your dear heart of whose memory of thee craves | THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (I.III.13), THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS (V.V.91), THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (III.XII.20) | Your heart from those whose memory you crave. |
| Get thee gone. Doctor, your service for this time is ended; | THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (II.III.34), CYMBELINE (I.VI.33) | Get out! Your service here is done, spirit. |
| There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave to tell me what I am. | THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (I.V.138), THE TEMPEST (I.II.40) | I need no ghost to tell me what is real. |
| Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me. Thou'lt forget me when I am gone. | THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (V.II.339), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (II.IV.215) | My legacy will stand when you're forgotten, |
| In the smoke of war, blown with all winds, and vanish'd from our sight. | TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL (V.I.41), MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING (III.I.69), THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (I.II.231) | A wisp of smoke dispersed by history's wind. |
| At your command, I must obey. And so farewell, for I must hence again. | PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (III.IV.3), THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (V.II.141), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (IV.V.11) | As you command, so I must now depart. |

| With this remembrance: that you use the same; they set the same; and there it doth remain, | THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (V.II.116), THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (II.I.66) | The equation of remembrance stands unchanged: |
| Forced in the ruthless, which forced such way; I gave it freely ever, and there's none. | THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (IV.I.54), KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (II.IV.196), THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS (I.II.11) | What's forced is lost; what's freely given, stays. |
| But in the other's silence do I see hear the truth of it | THE TAMING OF THE SHREW (I.I.70), THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR (I.IV.60) | Perhaps in silence, you might hear the truth |
| What means this shouting? Hath stopped the passage where thy words should enter. | THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (I.II.84), THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (I.III.22) | That shouting has prevented you from grasping. |
| Th' untimely emptying of the happy throne, throne and kingdom say | THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (IV.III.76), THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (II.I.93) | The throne room's emptiness speaks volumes more |
| Stronger than ever law could make; this secret | CYMBELINE (II.II.42) | Than any law could ever hope to tell. |
| By my former lecture and advice to chide at me that admonish me | THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (II.I.71), AS YOU LIKE IT (III.V.131), THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (V.III.3) | The nerve to lecture me on legacy! |
| As if this flesh which walls about our life, so great weight in his lightness, as they say spirits do. | KING RICHARD THE SECOND (III.II.167), THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (I.IV.26), KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (V.I.17) | As if a spirit knows the weight of flesh, |
| Bearing the wanton burden of the prime upon his brow | THE SONNETS (I.97.7), TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL (V.I.233) | The burden of a crown upon the brow, |
| Alas why fearing of time 's tyranny with time 's deformed hand | THE SONNETS (I.115.9), THE COMEDY OF ERRORS (V.I.301) | The constant threat of time's erasing hand. |
| If there come truth from them, where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed. | THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (III.I.6), THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (II.II.164) | And yet... what if there's truth beneath the words? |
| But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt from your prize | KING RICHARD THE THIRD (V.III.273), THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (II.IV.203) | What if my grasp is what repels the prize? |
| Nor how my father would enforce me marry | THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA (IV.III.18) | My father never spoke of how he'd be |
| And to remember what he does, and will remembered be, And all the rest forgot for which he toiled | PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (II.PROLOGUE.13), LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST (IV.III.91), THE SONNETS (I.25.12) | Rememberedâ€”only what he would achieve. |
| This monument five hundred years hath stood, the period of their tyranny. | THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (I.I.354), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (III.I.149) | These walls have witnessed centuries of rule, |
| But few now living can behold that goodness where now he sits | KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (V.IV.25), THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (I.I.169) | Yet few who sat where I now sit remain |
| More than light airs and recollected terms, Writ in the glassy margents of such books; | TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL (II.IV.5), THE RAPE OF LUCRECE (I.I.102) | As more than footnotes in some dusty text. |
| Were such things here as we do speak about? And did they so? | THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (I.III.85), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (III.VII.23) | The ones we speak of stillâ€”what did they do? |
| No, no, I will not, having breath to cry. I do refuse it. Go vanish into air. | THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (III.IV.38), THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (I.IX.43), THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (III.I.17) | No! I refuse to vanish like the rest. |
| And if words will not then will these hands | THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (V.I.140), THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (V.I.32) | If spirits won't assist, then human hands |
| To build his fortune I will strain a little, for I am rightful heir unto the crown. | THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS (I.I.165), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (IV.II.101) | Will build the legacy I rightfully deserve. |
| Tomorrow will I send I will do a greater thing than that | THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET (II.II.161), THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR (I.I.179) | Tomorrow I'll commission greater works, |
| Methinks no face so gracious is as mine, for which I rais'd my likeness. Cold statues of the youth. | THE SONNETS (I.62.5), THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (I.IV.4), TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (V.X.21) | More statues bearing likeness to my face, |
| All levied in my name, have in my name, what law does vouch mine own. | THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (V.III.121), ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (II.V.79) | More laws that bear the imprint of my name. |
| That memory, the warder of the brain, as this day's battle's fought | THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (I.VII.72), THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (IV.VII.111) | If history's a battlefield of memory, |
| An army have I muster'd in my thoughts, those will I muster up; none such in the army. | THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (I.I.101), THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (IV.VIII.11), MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING (I.I.23) | Then I'll amass an army none can match. |
| And still the choir of echoes answer so, but yet so coldly, For still tis beating in my mind | VENUS AND ADONIS (I.I.840), THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA (IV.IV.95), THE TEMPEST (I.II.205) | Yet still that cold voice echoes in my mind: |
| Save what is had, or must from you be took. For what 's given freely, freely have they leave. | THE SONNETS (I.75.12), A WINTER'S TALE (I.I.13), ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (I.II.17) | "What's forced is lost; what's freely given, stays." |
| The truth thou art unsure; 'tis a strange truth. | THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (III.I.289), THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (V.II.219) | What nonsense... what... unsettling truth perhaps? |
| The vaporous night approaches; I am a king. | MEASURE FOR MEASURE (IV.I.59), THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (IV.VI.203) | The night approaches. I am still a king. |
| Tomorrow in the battle think on me, to-morrow sharpened in his former might. | KING RICHARD THE THIRD (V.III.166), THE SONNETS (I.56.4) | Tomorrow's light will bring new strategies. |
| But empty lodgings and unfurnished walls, the night 's dead silence in this goodly chamber | KING RICHARD THE SECOND (I.II.68), THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA (III.II.84), THE TAMING OF THE SHREW (INDUCTION.II.82) | For now, the silence of this empty room |
| What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong? The urging of that word "judgement" hath bred a kind of remorse in me. | THE MERCHANT OF VENICE (IV.I.90), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (I.IV.102) | Feels strangely like a judgment I can't flee. |
