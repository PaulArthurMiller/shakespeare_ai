| Within a month, as is the night before some festival, merry springtime's harbinger, | THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (I.II.156), THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET (III.II.29), THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (I.I.8) | In one month's time, when the spring festival |
| Brings home his lord and other company; and all the peers and nobles of the realm | THE RAPE OF LUCRECE (I.I.1584), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (I.III.116) | Brings nobles from across the kingdom, |
| We'll all present ourselves, to give our hearts united ceremony. | THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR (IV.IV.64), THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR (IV.VI.49) | We will present our unified front. |

| But for true need, there is not now a rebel's sword unsheathed. | THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (II.IV.291), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (IV.IV.89) | But for its true meaning. We stand not as rebels, |
| Others, but stewards of their excellence: Whiles they behold a greater than themselves, under one man's awe | THE SONNETS (I.94.8), THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (I.II.215), THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (II.I.52) | But as guardians of a legacy greater than one man's ambition. |

| Build his statue to make him glorious: With the memorials and the things of fame | PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (II.PROLOGUE.14), TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL (III.III.24) | Building monuments, commissioning histories, |

| Like water from ye, never found again from his hands | KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (II.I.148), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (IV.I.69) | Through his fingers like sand. |
| Between whose endless jar justice resides— such harmony is in immortal souls. | TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (I.III.118), THE MERCHANT OF VENICE (V.I.68) | But true immortality lies in just governance, |
| Then belike my children shall have no names with my ancestors | THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (I.II.33), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (IV.IV.63) | In a kingdom where children speak their ancestors' names |
| With a proud heart and show no sign of fear. | THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (II.III.139), THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (IV.VI.184) | With pride, not fear. |
| And must we be divided? And therefore are we certainly resolved our purpose may hold there. | KING RICHARD THE SECOND (V.I.81), THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (V.I.37), THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (IV.VII.176) | Are we united in this purpose? |
| We are. | KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (V.II.150) | We are. |
| Then let it do at once the tide will wash you off | THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (IV.XIV.103), THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (V.IV.31) | Then let it begin. The tide that sweeps away |
| Where we do reign and by starts with this note | THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (III.I.159), THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (IV.XII.8), THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (V.IV.65) | Mortimer's reign starts tonight, with this ripple. |

| Let us hear them speak whereof we have record. | THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (II.I.204), TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (I.III.14) | Let us give them something worth recording. |
| Haply I see a friend will save my life, should see salvation. | THE COMEDY OF ERRORS (V.I.286), THE MERCHANT OF VENICE (IV.I.202) | They see a savior where I need salvation. |
| Although apparent guilt be seen in them; I see it feelingly in my conscience. | KING RICHARD THE SECOND (IV.I.126), THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (IV.VI.152), THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS (III.III.18) | They see conviction where I feel only corners. |
| A mighty strength they carry and holds belief enough to make us all | THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (II.I.21), THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (V.VII.6), THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (II.II.44) | Yet their belief may be enough to carry us all |
| Come o'er the bourn of this wild river break | THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (III.VI.22), KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (III.II.244) | Across this river of no return. |
| Whose fall the mark of his ambition is, for by his fall my honour must keep high. | THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS (V.IV.10), PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (I.I.149) | Mortimer's fall shall be my rise— |
| And though man's face be fearful to their eyes, they never see truly | THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (II.II.27), TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (III.II.57) | Though they must never glimpse that truth |
| And with a virtuous visard hide deep vice! me behind the arras in my rage | KING RICHARD THE THIRD (II.II.28), MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING (I.III.42), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (II.I.57) | Behind my mask of righteous indignation. |
| For thy escape, to make a virtue of necessity, become a man | THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (I.III.216), THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA (IV.I.61), AS YOU LIKE IT (III.IV.3) | Sometimes to escape the noose, one must become |
| Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword. So be it. | THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (II.II.123), THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (III.IV.142) | The executioner. So be it. |
