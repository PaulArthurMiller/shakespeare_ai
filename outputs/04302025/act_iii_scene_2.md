| And the enjoying of our griefs together torments him so. | THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (II.II.65), THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET (II.IV.3) | That's why our moments together disturb him so. |
| Since that my beauty cannot please his eye, for he is not like to marry me well | THE COMEDY OF ERRORS (II.I.112), AS YOU LIKE IT (III.III.65) | Not just because I'm unsuitable in his eyes, |

| Well, what would you say? Call it by what you will. | ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (II.V.75), PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (II.III.13) | And what would you call it? |
| own salvation? And a clear life ensuing. | THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (V.I.2), THE TEMPEST (III.III.96) | Salvation. Clarity. |
| a true thing in the world's false subtleties | AS YOU LIKE IT (III.III.13), THE SONNETS (I.138.4) | The one true thing in a world of lies. |
| Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not? Come like shadows, some there be that shadows kiss. | THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (I.I.150), THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (IV.I.122), THE MERCHANT OF VENICE (II.IX.67) | Then why do we still whisper? Why meet in shadows? |
| Love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth. | THE RAPE OF LUCRECE (I.I.270) | Love shouldn't have to hide to survive. |
| The time shall come that the time may have all shadow and silence in it | THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (III.I.75), MEASURE FOR MEASURE (III.I.242) | Edgar, a time is coming—soon—when silence |

| My father hath a power in the force of his will | KING RICHARD THE SECOND (III.II.186), MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING (I.I.172) | Your father shapes the world through force of will, |
| But see, while idly I stood looking on, stand thou back. | THE TAMING OF THE SHREW (I.I.140), THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (I.III.38) | While you stand back and watch it happen. |
| Make choice; and, see, choice of loss, For some must watch, while some must sleep, | ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (II.III.68), THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (III.I.25), THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (III.II.251) | But watching is a choice, and choices have costs. |
| Silence no more. Why are you silent? Speak, or thy silence on the instant is. | THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (IV.I.144), THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (IV.III.150), CYMBELINE (III.V.117) | The price of your silence grows every day. |
| What wouldst thou have me do? Will either of you bear me a challenge to him? | PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (I.II.69), TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL (III.II.29) | What would you have me do? Challenge him openly? |
| You stand within his danger, do you not? So mighty are his vowed enemies. | THE MERCHANT OF VENICE (IV.I.180), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (III.I.220) | You know what happens to those who stand against him. |

| Now make your choice. Remember who you are. | THE MERCHANT OF VENICE (II.VII.3), KING RICHARD THE SECOND (III.II.82) | I'm asking you to decide who you are |

| Canst thou believe thy living is a life, whether you will or no. | MEASURE FOR MEASURE (III.II.21), THE TEMPEST (III.I.101) | It's about whether you'll let your life be lived |
| Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard, and let it come. | THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (III.VII.58), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (V.III.43) | Or simply let it happen to you. |

| What is't you say? the life? To stab at half an hour of my life. | THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (II.III.67), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (IV.V.109) | Including what? This half-life we're living? |
| Allowing him a breath, a little scene, 'Twixt hour and hour? What more commands he? | KING RICHARD THE SECOND (III.II.164), CYMBELINE (III.II.67), ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (II.IV.43) | These stolen moments between his commands? |
| I speak not as desiring more, Edgar his banished son. | MEASURE FOR MEASURE (I.IV.3), THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (IV.VII.104) | I don't speak from selfishness, Edgar. |

| If your self 's remembrance wrong yourself, that thou art then estranged from thyself? | KING RICHARD THE THIRD (IV.IV.434), THE COMEDY OF ERRORS (II.II.107) | If what's remembered isn't truly you? |

| I have been so affrighted with so strong a fear the fear we have of him | THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (II.I.82), THE RAPE OF LUCRECE (I.I.1647), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (III.I.234) | I've been so afraid of his disappointment, |
| I am almost afraid to stand alone In shadow of such greatness | THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET (V.III.10), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (IV.II.15) | So terrified of standing in his shadow, |

| For we tomorrow hold divided councils, | KING RICHARD THE THIRD (III.I.180) | Tomorrow, when he calls the council meeting, |
| That I will work against him, not as foes, myself in counsel, his competitor. | ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (IV.II.35), PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (I.IV.73), THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA (II.VI.35) | I'll speak against his plan. Not as his rival, |
| And not as our confusion, rebellious to oppose, finding his usurpation most unjust | THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS (V.V.60), THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (I.II.114), THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (II.V.68) | Not as some rebel seeking to usurp, |
| yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him whose way himself will choose | THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (III.VI.12), KING RICHARD THE SECOND (II.I.29) | But as his son who sees a different path. |
| I 'll go another way to work with him, one that is not true | TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL (IV.I.27), THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR (I.I.48) | I'll offer another way forward—one that doesn't |
| Do in his name religiously demand and do upon mine altar sacrifice. | THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (III.I.142), PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (V.I.270) | Require the sacrifices he demands. |
| Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath, what you have spoke, it may be so, perchance. | THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (III.IV.215), THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (IV.III.11) | Are you certain? Once spoken, such words |
| What cannot be amended. It is irrevocable. | THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (IV.VII.13), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (III.II.293) | Cannot be taken back or reinterpreted. |
| I have too long borne, for you have but mistook me all this while. Wisdom, and constancy, hath amaz'd me more | KING RICHARD THE THIRD (I.III.103), KING RICHARD THE SECOND (III.II.174), ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (II.I.87) | For too long, I've mistaken logic for wisdom, |
| To square for this, but want the understanding where to use it. | THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (II.I.106), THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (III.VI.270) | Calculation for understanding. |
| My father said so how to think and speak, and my father's precepts | THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (II.V.9), THE COMEDY OF ERRORS (III.II.33), THE TEMPEST (III.I.68) | My father taught me how to think, but not |
| That would I learn of you, what we feel. | KING RICHARD THE THIRD (IV.IV.273), THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (V.III.382) | How to feel—that, I learned from you. |
| If I do not stand up, I shall never begin if I hold my peace. | THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (II.V.77), THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (I.I.37), TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL (II.III.58) | If I don't stand now, I never will. |
| I'll never pause again, never stand still, And I'll be gone | THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (II.III.30), THE COMEDY OF ERRORS (IV.III.60) | And if I never stand, I'll disappear |
| Let's step into the shadow of these trees, what might I have been. | KING RICHARD THE SECOND (III.IV.27), A WINTER'S TALE (V.I.210) | Into the shadow of what might have been. |
| Go then; and with a countenance as clear. Persever in that clear way thou goest, come what will come. | A WINTER'S TALE (I.II.397), PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (IV.VI.88), LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST (V.II.115) | Then go with clear eyes, Edgar. Know that whatever comes, |
| Take your own way instead of him to follow him. | CYMBELINE (I.VI.34), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (V.IV.12), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (I.I.221) | You chose your path instead of following his. |
| The conclusion is victory; whate'er the course, the end is the renown. | LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST (IV.I.71), ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (IV.IV.40) | That alone is victory, whatever follows. |
| When possibly I can, I will return. | THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA (II.II.3) | When I return, I'll be changed—for better or worse. |
| Than doth become a man. I will remain | CYMBELINE (I.II.29) | But I'll return as my own man, at last. |
| Stay here with us by this light. Let me stand here till thou remember it. | THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH (V.II.92), THE TAMING OF THE SHREW (II.I.276), THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET (II.II.183) | Stay here, in this light. Let it remind you |
| The which hath fire in darkness, none in light: even in the jaws of danger and of death. | PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (II.III.46), THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (V.II.117) | That even in darkness, some flames refuse to die. |
| And strange it is how far that little candle throws his beams! | THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (V.I.34), THE MERCHANT OF VENICE (V.I.95) | How strange that such a small light |
| To help him of his blindness for a true man for men to see, and seeing wonder at. | THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA (IV.II.45), THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR (II.I.110), PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (II.II.7) | Can finally help a man to truly see. |
| Between his purpose and his conscience, to show yourself your father's son in deed. | THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (IV.II.78), THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (IV.VII.137) | In choosing to confront his father's legacy, |
| And death's dim look in life's mortality. | THE RAPE OF LUCRECE (I.I.403) | He confronts his own mortality— |
| Not body's death, but body's banishment, or something deeper | THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET (III.III.12), THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (III.I.30) | Not the death of flesh, but something deeper: |
| This thought is as a death which cannot choose of your choice | THE SONNETS (I.64.13), KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (II.IV.59) | The death of possibility, of choice, of self. |
| Yet may he live a while to live till he be old before he die,—as | MEASURE FOR MEASURE (II.IV.38), THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (III.VII.74), THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (V.I.133) | May he find the strength to live before he dies. |
