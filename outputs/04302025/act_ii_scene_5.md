| Herein lives wisdom whose compass is no bigger than thy head; | THE SONNETS (I.11.5), KING RICHARD THE SECOND (II.I.101) | Logic without wisdom is a compass |

| Silence! you have seen all this and To countenance this horror! | THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (IV.II.28), CYMBELINE (II.IV.116), THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (II.III.79) | Bashir! You see this horror and stand silent? |

| Calmly, I do beseech you. | THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (III.III.40) | (calmly) |
| A woman of quick sense, and very sudden in choler. The lady protests too much, methinks. | TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (IV.V.62), THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (II.I.269), THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (III.II.214) | Leila, always quick to dramatize. |

| Which in their wills count bad what I think good? | THE SONNETS (I.121.8) | Who defines this good? Mortimer? The Djinn? |

| My heart is turned to stone forsake your liberty. | THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (V.II.50), THE COMEDY OF ERRORS (IV.III.18) | When did your heart turn cold to liberty? |
| Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits shall I not lie in publishing a truth? | THE SONNETS (I.41.1), TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (V.II.136) | Liberty is not the freedom to mislead. |
| Pain pays the income of each precious thing: it is but change, and, for these great affairs do ask some charge. | THE RAPE OF LUCRECE (I.I.334), THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR (V.III.53), KING RICHARD THE SECOND (II.I.161) | Progress demands a price—all change does. |
| Be reined again to temperance; then he speaks for a while. | THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (III.III.36), THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (II.II.330) | Some voices must be tempered for a time |
| Here 's a good world the while, for better times to come. | KING RICHARD THE THIRD (III.VI.10), MEASURE FOR MEASURE (V.I.515) | While we transition to a better world. |

| From that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts, whereto the judgement of my heart is tied? | THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (II.I.112), THE SONNETS (I.137.8) | Where magic algorithms judge our thoughts? |

| But you are wise to see that day | THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (II.V.85), KING RICHARD THE SECOND (IV.I.42) | You're smart enough to see beyond the moment. |
| That ends this strange eventful history towards his design. | AS YOU LIKE IT (II.VII.167), THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (II.I.62) | History's arc bends toward this evolution. |

| Which is the side that I must go withal? To stand on either part. | THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (III.I.336), ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (I.II.18) | Which side of progress do you choose to stand on? |

| All the power this charm doth owe; Disguise the holy strength of their command, With an invisible and subtle stealth | A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (II.II.78), TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (II.III.105), TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL (I.V.244) | It's power cloaked in technological charm. |
| Though thou speakest truth, not fearing the displeasure of your master, | THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (I.VI.15), ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (V.III.263) | The Philosopher spoke truths that scared your master, |
| Th' ambassador is silenced for the example of others. | KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (I.I.114), MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING (V.I.298) | So he was silenced, made example of. |
| And here I stand and justify you traitors: at this time | THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (II.IV.345), THE TEMPEST (V.I.141) | And now you stand here, justifying it |
| With golden promises of things to come at large and for future good. | THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (IV.IV.95), TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (I.III.351), A WINTER'S TALE (V.I.38) | With vague appeals to some grand future good. |
| It is determined, not concluded yet; by the figure it is proved. | KING RICHARD THE THIRD (I.III.15), THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR (IV.II.129), MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING (V.II.70) | The future isn't vague—it's calculated, |
| I see, as in a map, the end of all, and thou see'st it not. | KING RICHARD THE THIRD (II.IV.56), THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET (III.III.29) | Mapped with precision you refuse to see. |

| That they behold and see not what they see what we do not see | THE SONNETS (I.137.2), MEASURE FOR MEASURE (II.I.26) | The Djinn sees patterns humans can't discern. |
| That 's my fear, that makes us tremble, of what is to be dreaded. | THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (I.II.144), THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (V.III.268), THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (IV.VI.67) | And that's precisely what should terrify us! |
| We thus submit unto,—our sovereign One thing or other to the other | PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (II.IV.40), THE TEMPEST (I.II.417), AS YOU LIKE IT (V.IV.149) | We hand our agency to something other, |
| Not dreams we stand before your puissance, and our devices known, that know things. | THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN (I.I.170), A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (I.II.80), THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (I.II.7) | Something that knows our data, not our dreams. |
| He 'll not feel wrongs, weighs not the dust and injury of age | THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (IV.II.14), THE SONNETS (I.108.10) | The Djinn can't feel the weight of consequence, |
| Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel, and for dissension, who preferreth peace? | TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (II.II.126), THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (III.I.33) | Can't understand the value of dissent. |
| Serves for the matter that is then born in't, a dream and fruitless vision. | THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (II.II.13), A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (III.II.385) | It serves Mortimer's vision, nothing more. |
| A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh | CYMBELINE (IV.II.67) | (sighing) |
| I came not to hear this, that change the mind; thence will not I today. | THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (IV.III.95), THE COMEDY OF ERRORS (I.II.99), MEASURE FOR MEASURE (IV.III.48) | I didn't come to change your mind today. |
| But mark me, look what is done cannot be now amended. | MEASURE FOR MEASURE (II.IV.88), KING RICHARD THE THIRD (IV.IV.298) | But mark my words: this tide cannot be turned. |
| The silent of the night will shortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none. We as the spring of all shall pay for all. | THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (I.IV.14), THE MERCHANT OF VENICE (III.V.32), THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (V.II.24) | The silent price of progress will be paid |
| To stand the push and enmity of those from those that wish the downfall of our house! | TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (II.II.140), THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (V.VI.65) | By those who stand against its forward march. |
| Let go his arm | THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (IV.VI.246) | (grabbing his arm) |
| And long hereafter say unto his child, "That men would tell their children, "This is he."" | THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (II.II.36), THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (III.II.48) | Is this what you'll tell children years from now? |
| That truth should be silent I had almost forgot. | THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (II.II.130) | That silencing the truth was necessary? |
| His liberty is full of threats to all, because more dangerous from too much liberty. | THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (IV.I.15), THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (IV.III.15), MEASURE FOR MEASURE (I.II.97) | That freedom was too dangerous to keep? |
| Why, look you there! look how it steals away! Her voice is stopp'd the snatches in his voice. | THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (III.IV.150), VENUS AND ADONIS (I.I.1061), CYMBELINE (IV.II.136) | Look at that man—his voice stolen mid-sentence! |
| Is it your will in your choice and no legacy is so rich as honesty? | THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (I.IV.235), THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (I.I.17), ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL (III.V.10) | Is this the legacy you choose to build? |
| away. | THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (III.I.18) | (pulling away) |
| You that survive, and you that sleep in fame, Whose memory is written on the earth. | THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (I.I.173), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (IV.I.84) | Legacy is written by survivors, Leila. |
| These that survive abide the change of time, or thrive by other means. | THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (I.I.82), CYMBELINE (II.IV.5), THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (V.III.37) | And survivors adapt to changing times. |
| And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you— Be friends awhile, and both conjointly bend | THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA (III.II.63), THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (II.I.386) | I hope, for friendship's sake, you learn to bend |
| Before the always-wind-obeying deep, that you must I must break. | THE COMEDY OF ERRORS (I.I.63), THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (II.III.221), THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (I.II.113) | Before the wind decides that you must break. |
| be wary how you place your words for our words | THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH (III.II.3), THE MERCHANT OF VENICE (V.I.122) | Perhaps we should be careful what we say... |
| Such a one is a natural philosopher. He last asked the question. | AS YOU LIKE IT (III.II.26), THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS (II.II.67) | The Philosopher was only asking questions. |
| And controversy hence a question takes, the ways are dangerous. | A LOVER'S COMPLAINT (I.I.110), THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (IV.V.19) | Questions have become dangerous, it seems. |
| Come, let's be gone. | THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (I.III.31) | Let's go. There's nothing more to see today. |
| Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well. | MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING (V.III.29) | (to the departing crowd) |
| See see your silence! Your silence most offends me. | TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (III.II.108), MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING (II.I.243) | Your silence now becomes complicity! |
| You start away, so every step, to thrive in this new world | THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (I.III.222), TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (I.III.132), KING RICHARD THE SECOND (IV.I.80) | Each step away, a vote for this new world |
| Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten by chance but not by truth | THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH (II.IV.73), THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN (I.I.170) | Where words are measured not by truth but threat. |
| Tomorrow may it please you to be crowned your voice broken | KING RICHARD THE THIRD (III.VII.240), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (I.II.140) | Tomorrow it could be your voice that's taken, |
| Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot, thou hid'st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts, seditious to his grace and to the state. | KING RICHARD THE SECOND (V.V.18), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (IV.V.107), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH (V.I.37) | Your thoughts deemed dangerous to Mortimer's plan. |
| Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee, ever to pay and yet pay still. | THE SONNETS (I.101.10), CYMBELINE (I.V.28) | The price of silence isn't paid at once, |
| Each fair instalment, creeps in this petty pace from day to day, | THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR (V.V.55), THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH (V.V.22) | But in small installments, day by passing day, |
| Till one can do no more, with clamorous demands of debt, all that we call ours. | THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS (I.II.41), THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS (II.II.44), THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (IV.V.211) | Until the debt consumes all that we are. |
| I will not look upon | TROILUS AND CRESSIDA (V.VI.11) | I will not watch our humanity |
| Melt and no more be seen into the raging sea in fearful sense. | PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE (V.III.50), THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA (I.II.128), THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (I.III.15) | Dissolve into a sea of muted fear. |
| Which the most precious square of sense possesses, with voices and applause of every sort, in the thought | THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR (I.I.67), THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS (I.I.231), THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR (V.V.112) | This square, once filled with voices raised in thought, |
| And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth. | THE TAMING OF THE SHREW (INDUCTION.II.44) | Now echoes with the hollowness of dread. |
| But not the words. Not sound, I say. A single voice, and that not passed me but | THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (IV.II.38), KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (V.II.135), KING HENRY THE EIGHTH (I.II.81) | But they forget—a voice is not just sound. |
| It is to act action. I have begun. | THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK (V.I.9), THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH (I.II.116), MEASURE FOR MEASURE (II.IV.171) | It's action, too. And mine has just begun. |
